# Employee-attendence-system
An employee attendance website where employees input their id, and a clock-in time is stored in a database for their id using an API. When employee clocks-out, it updates the object in the database using another API. The database can then be accessed in a table by the employer in the website.

Technologies used: Python, JavaScript, Django, APIs

# Motivation 
All my colleagues and I would use pen and paper to clock-in by writing our employee id, full name etc. on sheet of paper, which my site manager would then take hours to tediously type into an excel spreadsheet. To improve this, I developed an employee attendance website to make it efficient for my colleagues to clock-in to create a database of attendance while also potentially saving my site manager hours of tedious data entry work.

# Quick Start
Either
a.	Run the website link
NOTE: may have to 50 seconds for the website to load for the first time as a free hosting is used
Navigate to the following Link:
Type in your employee id and press submit. It will record your clock-in time. 
b.	Run the code on your own computer
